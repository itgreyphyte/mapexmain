# Case Studies – Mapex

## Case Study: Geo-Enabled West Bengal’s Land Records
Mapex (formerly Azure Cloud Services, GIS division of Azure Knowledge Corporation) partnered with the Directorate of Land Records & Surveys (DLRS), Government of West Bengal, to digitize and geo-reference over **68,000 analogue cadastral maps** across **42,302 revenue villages**.

---
### The Challenge
- Land records lacked spatial references and existed only on paper.
- 68,000+ cadastral maps, 42,302 villages, no centralized system.
- Result: inefficiency, low trust, and increased litigation.
---
### Our 4-Stage Georeferencing Approach
#### Stage I: Ground Control Network
- Used 50 cm satellite imagery and DGPS surveys.
- Placed Primary (25 km²) and Secondary (5 km²) Ground Control Points (GCPs).
- All GCPs were monumented and geotagged.
#### Stage II: Spatial Data Preparation
- Stereo triangulation and bundle-block adjustments.
- Created DEMs and 1 m contour maps.
- Edge-matched, color-balanced, and mosaicked ortho-imagery.
#### Stage III: Mono Imagery Georeferencing
- Acquired 30 cm mono imagery.
- Batch processed and aligned to GCPs with sub-meter accuracy.
#### Stage IV: Cadastral Map Georeferencing
- Superimposed scanned cadastral maps onto ortho-imagery.
- Vector alignment, topology validation, and mosaicking.
- QA/QC was independently verified by DLRS.
---
### Impact & Results
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Citizens can access accurate, authoritative land records online.
- **Accelerated Transactions**: Integrated with Land Records Maintenance and Registration systems.
- **Dispute Reduction**: Greater clarity and legal accuracy.
- **Scalable Foundation**: Enables e-governance, urban planning, and resource management.
