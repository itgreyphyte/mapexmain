# CASE STUDY

## Building the Future of E-Governance  
### How Mapex Digitized and Geo-Enabled West Bengal’s Land Records

---

### Overview

In this case study, we explore **Mapex’s** (formerly Azure Cloud Services, the GIS division of Azure Knowledge Corporation) collaboration with the **Directorate of Land Records & Surveys (DLRS)**, Government of West Bengal.

The objective was to transform over **68,000 analogue cadastral maps** into a comprehensively **geo‐referenced, digital land‐records system** that would increase efficiency in governance.

The project was conducted across four stages and delivered **sub‐meter accuracy** across **42,302 revenue villages**. This modernisation has:

- Driven transparency  
- Accelerated transactions  
- Reduced disputes  
- Established a scalable platform for future e-governance and planning initiatives.

### The Challenge

West Bengal’s land‐records system comprised over **68,000 cadastral maps** across **42,302 revenue villages**.  
These records:

- Lacked embedded spatial references  
- Were not available digitally  
- Led to inefficiency, low citizen trust, and increased litigation

---

### Our Approach

We, at Mapex, designed a **four-stage, end-to-end georeferencing methodology**:

#### Stage I: Ground Control Network Establishment

- Collected 50 cm archived satellite imagery (ORI) and existing primary control points  
- Planned grid-based placement of new **Primary (25 km²)** and **Secondary (5 km²)** Ground Control Points (GCPs) using **DGPS surveys**  
- Monumented and geotagged control points with rigorous field documentation

#### Stage II: Spatial Data Preparation

- Performed satellite triangulation and bundle-block adjustment on stereo imagery  
- Generated high-resolution DEMs and 1 m contour maps  
- Edge-matched, color-balanced, and mosaicked ortho-rectified imagery

#### Stage III: Mono Imagery Georeferencing

- Acquired **30 cm fresh mono imagery** for plain regions  
- Georeferenced imagery to DGPS GCPs ensuring sub-meter accuracy  
- Conducted batch processing of mosaics

#### Stage IV: Cadastral Map Geo-Referencing

- Superimposed scanned raster cadastral maps over ortho-imagery  
- Aligned existing vector datasets  
- Performed topology validation, edge matching, and mosaicking

> All stages underwent **rigorous QA/QC**, with independent sample verifications by the Directorate.

- **Capacity Building**  
  > Trained Directorate staff in GIS workflows, imagery processing, and maintenance

---

### Impact & Results

- **Enhanced Transparency**  
  > Citizens access authoritative, spatially accurate land records online

- **Accelerated Transactions**  
  > Integration of Land Records Maintenance System (LRMS) and Registration workflows

- **Dispute Reduction**  
  > Greater clarity supports credit security and minimizes disputes

- **Foundational Platform**  
  > Database enables land reform, urban planning, watershed management, and e-services

### Key Statistics

- 4 structured project stages  
- From imagery collection to vector map alignment

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **42,302** | Revenue villages mapped |
| **68,453** | Cadastral sheets georeferenced |
| **22+** | District-wide satellite imagery analyses |
| **100%** | QA/QC compliance with RMS error targets |

---

### Conclusion

By modernizing **West Bengal’s land records** into a seamless, spatially enabled system, **Mapex** empowered government authorities to deliver **citizen-centric, dispute-free land administration**.

This large-scale exercise laid the **foundation for India’s next generation of digital land governance.**
