## CASE STUDY

### West Bengal‚Äôs Land Records

In this case study, we explore Mapex‚Äôs (formerly Azure Cloud Services, the GIS division of Azure Knowledge Corporation) collaboration with the Directorate of Land Records & Surveys (DLRS), Government of West Bengal. The objective of this was for us to transform over 68,000 analogue cadastral maps into a comprehensively geo‚Äêreferenced, digital land‚Äêrecords system that would increase efficiency when it comes to governance.

The project was conducted across four stages and towards its conclusion, delivered sub‚Äêmeter accuracy across 42,302 revenue villages. This modernisation has driven transparency, accelerated transactions, reduced disputes, and established a scalable platform for future e-governance and planning initiatives.
